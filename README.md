# Decision Tree Classification Project

This project is a demonstration of classification using decision trees. Decision trees are a popular machine learning algorithm used for predictive modeling that works by dividing the data into smaller and smaller subsets based on specific conditions until it reaches a final prediction. All necessary information about the project is in the jupyter notebook file.
